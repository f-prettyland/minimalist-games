## What You Need  
- 5 dice per player
- Preferable a cup, but hands will do

## The Low Down  

# Objective  
Keep your dice, you run outta dice, you're outta the game.

# The Set up  
Give everyone their 5 dice

# The Play  
Everyone rolls and keeps their dice secret.

Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. "there are ten sixes". However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct.

To raise the bet each successive player must bid by either increasing the quantity (the number of dice alike) or the value on the dice (see Examples Bidding).

When all dice are revealed ones count as wild cards, they count towards the total of what-ever number being counted. Thus the chance of rolling any number is other than ones is 1/3, not 1/6.

## Examples  

# Counting  
If there were a total of 6 threes, 2 fours and 5 ones rolled in a round, the effective number of threes rolled would be 11, if the bet was on threes. Or 7 fours if the bet was on fours.

# Biddding  
The first player may bid "4 threes". The second player could then bid "5 threes" or "4 fours". They could not bid, however, "3 sixes", because neither of the values can ever drop.

Note that players are not limited to just bidding the next step up either; they may increase the bid by any amount they wish. So in the above scenario, the second player could also bid "12 sixes" if they wanted to.

## Optional Rules

# The Less Wild Ones  
Someone starts the round betting on ones? They're no longer wild for the duration of this round.

# Exactly Right  
With this ruling, if a player ever gets challenged, and has got the quantity of that value of dice *bang on*, exactly correct, then everyone must lose a die except the player being challenged.

This ruling just __speeds up__ the game a bit and keeps it interesting. If you want to slow the game down a bit try out that only the challenger loses a die as in Perudo, but gives it to the player with the exact bid.

# One Die Calls  
When a player drops down to one die they gain a one time ability use[^2] where before dice are rolled they may call either:  

- Blind  
- Palafico <sub>AKA Calzone, Osprey Egg ...</sub>

**Blind**  
Only players with one die may look under their cups that turn.

**Palafico**  
Ones are not wild, and only players with one die can increase the face value of bids, all players with more than one die must follow the face value of preceding bids.

# Roll and Reveal
**ADVANCED PLAY**  
After making a bid, a player can save one or more of his dice and reveal them for the rest of the round, and then re-roll the rest of his remaining dice.

This rule is golden, after you get used to the normal rules, be sure to add in this for more information and interesting plays.
