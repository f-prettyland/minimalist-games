## What You Need  
- Cards from 1-15 (or 1-13 will do if you've got a French deck)
- 4 coins per player plus eight

## The Low Down
You are trying to end up with the highest card at the end of the round.

Each player is dealt a card and one card is placed face up in the center, the Kobayakawa samurai card. Each player receives 4 coins and 8 are placed in the pool.

On a turn, you may draw one card and may exchange it with the card in your hand, the other card not kept is discarded. Instead you may replace the card in the center with a new card from the deck. After each player has done their turn, they may then choose to bid 1 coin if they think they will win.

The cards are revealed and the highest number wins, **however** the lowest played card gets to add the Kobayakawa card to theirs and if the sum is higher than the highest card that person wins. The winner collect coins bet plus one from the pool. In the 8th round, players must bid 2 coins to stay in and the highest card gets two coins from the pool as well as the other bids.

The winner is the one with the most coins after seven rounds (all coins in the middle are depleted)
