## The Low Down

Bluff about rolls

## How


<!-- ## Examples -->

## Optional Rules

# Exactly Right  

With this ruling, if a player ever gets challenged, and has got the quantity of that value of dice *bang on*, exactly correct, then everyone must lose a die except the player being challenged.

This ruling just __speeds up__ the game a bit and keeps it interesting. If you want to slow the game down a bit try out that only the challenger loses a die as in Perudo, but gives it to the player with the exact bid.

# One Die Calls
When a player drops down to one die they gain a one time ability use[^2] where before dice are rolled they may call either:  

- Blind  
- Palafico <sub>AKA Calzone, Osprey Egg ...</sub>

**Blind**  
Only players with one die may look under their cups that turn.

**Palafico**  
Ones are not wild, and only players with one die can increase the face value of bids, all players with more than one die must follow the face value of preceding bids.

# Roll and Reveal
**ADVANCED PLAY**  
After making a bid, a player can save one or more of his dice and reveal them for the rest of the round, and then re-roll the rest of his remaining dice.

This rule is golden, after you get used to the normal rules, be sure to add in this for more information and interesting plays.


## Footnotes

[^2]: Or depending on your ruleset, you may only immediately use then, at the beginning of the round after you just lost a die
