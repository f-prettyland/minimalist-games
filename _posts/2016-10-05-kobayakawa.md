## What You Need  
- Cards from 1-15 (or 1-13 will do if you've got a French deck)
- 4 coins per player plus eight

## The Low Down  

# Objective  
You are trying to end up with the highest card at the end of the each of the rounds to win money. Person with most money after seven rounds wins.

# The Set up  
Each player is dealt a card and one card is placed face up in the center, the Kobayakawa samurai card. Each player receives 4 coins and 8 are placed in the pool.

# The Play  
On a turn, you may draw one card and may exchange it with the card in your hand, the other card not kept is discarded. Instead you may replace the card in the center with a new card from the deck. After each player has done their turn, they may then choose to bid 1 coin if they think they will win.

The cards are revealed and the highest number wins, **however** the lowest played card gets to add the Kobayakawa card to theirs and if the sum is higher than the highest card that person wins. If there is a tie, the player closest to the starting player  of that round wins.

The winner collects all coins bet plus one from the pool. In the 7th round (the final), players must bid __2 coins__ to stay in and the highest card gets two coins from the pool as well as the other bids.

Then whoever wins the round, starts the next round.

## Example  

# End of Round Sum  
Kobayakawa: 8  
Player A: 9  
Player B: Pass  
Player C: 15  
Player D: 12  


Player A wins!  
Player C has the highest card value (15), but player A has the lowest card so sums on the Kobayakawa making player A's total 17.
