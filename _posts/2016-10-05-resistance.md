## The Low Down

# Objective
The Resistance (BLACK) players must successfully pass 3/5 missions, while the Spies (RED) must cause 3/5 of the missions to fail.

If during any rounds a proposed "mission team" cannot be agreed to (if five different teams are proposed in a row and all are not approved) then the Spies (RED) win.

# The Set up
Draw out mission round planner, (like 5 circles with the number of people required) put a round marker on the first mission of the planner.
Deal out red and black cards indicating teams to everyone according to number playing (see Fiddly Bits at bottom).
Reveal Spies: everyone shuts their eyes; Spies open their eyes to identify one another.  

# The Play
Each round starts by giving each player a red and a black card (Reject / Approve) used to vote on mission teams.  

Assign "Team Leader" - for the first round it is random; after that it goes clockwise around the table. The Team Leader picks the players who they wants to be on the mission (refer to the drawn round marker to determine how many members are required).  

ALL players vote on whether to "Accept" (black) or "Reject" (black) the mission team's composition, all turning over their vote card at the same time. If there is majority approval the team gies ahead. If not, then the Team Leader card passes to player left of the current one. Repeat same procedure (unles there have been 5 rejecting of teams in a row, in which case spies win).

Once a Mission Team is approved, then each player on the team receives two missions cards: one "Failure" (RED) and one "Success" (BLACK).  

Mission team members secretly vote on whether the mission fails or succeeds by placing face down one of the two cards, which are shuffled and then revealed. Outcome of mission is given by:  
  + At least one Fail -> the mission fails. Mark the mission on the planner as a point for spies  
    - Except on Mission 4, two Fail cards are required to fail it.  
  + All Success, mark the planner appropriately  

Shuffle together all the Mission cards (used and unused) and divide into two piles, move up the round marker, go again.
