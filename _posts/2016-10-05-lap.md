## What You Need
- 2 bits of paper
- 2 pencils/pens

## The Low Down

# Objective
You are trying to figure out the opponents sketched pattern.

# The Set up  
Each player secretly draws dividing lines on a grid of 8x8 cells, creating four sectors of exactly 16 squares.

# The Play  
Take turns guessing 2x2 area, the opponent must respond how many of each numbered region is covering that 2x2 square.  
Once someone thinks they have the opponent's layout exact, they call a stop to the game and check if correct. If it is, they win, else they lose.

## Example  
![Example lap board](../static/lap.png)
<img src="../static/lap.png" width="200">  
Opposing player asks "C4 to D5"  
Response could be "Two twos, one three and one four" or "One three, two twos and one four" or something to that effect
